def main():
    # 1. What is one basic benefit of using a context manager when working with files?
    # 2. What is the difference between 'read()' and 'readline()'?
    # 3. Write a script that creates a file called 'episode7_practice.txt' and writes
    #    "Hello, this is a practice file.\nI am practicing reading and writing files in Python." to it.
    # 4. Read the file you created in multiple ways using 'read()', 'readline()', and 'readlines()'.
    # 5. Write a script that reads 'episode7_practice.txt' and prints out the first 10 characters of the file.
    # 6. Write a script that truncates the file to just the first line.  Note, use code to figure out
    #    how many characters to truncate the file to.  Be sure to use the correct mode when opening the file.
