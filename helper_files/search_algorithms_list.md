# Prominent Search Algorithms in Use Today

## Web Search Algorithms

- **PageRank** - Google's foundational algorithm that ranks pages based on link authority and relevance
- **RankBrain** - Google's machine learning system that helps interpret search queries and match them to relevant content
- **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) - Used by Google to better understand natural language context in search queries

## Database and Data Structure Search

- **Binary Search** - Efficiently searches sorted arrays with O(log n) time complexity
- **Hash Table Lookup** - Provides near-constant time search for key-value pairs
- **B-tree and B+ tree searches** - Used extensively in database indexing systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL

## Graph and Network Search

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Explores nodes level by level, used in social networks and shortest path problems
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Explores as far as possible along branches, used in maze solving and topological sorting
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm** - Finds shortest paths in weighted graphs, used in GPS navigation systems
- **A* Search** - Heuristic-based pathfinding algorithm used in gaming and robotics

## Text and Document Search

- **Inverted Index Search** - Core technology behind search engines like Elasticsearch and Apache Solr
- **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) - Statistical measure used to evaluate document relevance
- **Elasticsearch's Query DSL** - Powers search functionality for many applications and websites

## Specialized Search Algorithms

- **Approximate String Matching** (like Levenshtein distance) - Used in spell checkers and fuzzy search
- **Trie-based searches** - Efficient for prefix matching and autocomplete features
- **Vector similarity search** - Increasingly important for AI applications and recommendation systems
