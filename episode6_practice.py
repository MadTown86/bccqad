# Episode 6: Looping Concepts - Practice

"""
My intention here is to start increasing the level of difficulty on the assumption that 
you already understand the concepts from the earlier episodes.

    # 1. Create a list of 5 numbers and loop through the list to print each number.
    # 2. You have the following list: 
    l2 = ['B', 'L', 'U', 'E', 'B', 'E', 'R', 'R', 'Y']
    #     Using a while loop, create a new string that is the reverse of the original.
    #     s = 'YRREBEULB'

    l3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 54, 88, 72, 30, 54, 80, 123, 88]
    #    Using a for loop, alter l3 to add the elements index value to the elements value.
    #    For example, the first element in l3 is 1, so you would add 0 to 1 to get 1.
