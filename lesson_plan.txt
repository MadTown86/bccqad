Blue Collar Codes: The Quick and Dirty

Date: 3/24/2025

Goal:
Outline recommended learning pathway for beginners through Python.

Introduction:
These episodes are meant to teach Python by topic.  Beginning Python topics are first, then will increase in difficulty as I 
go through the topics.

A Recommendation For Beginners:
Unfortunately, you have to wade through the boring stuff first.  However, I made these videos short and the resources rich.  You
definitely can just watch the videos, download the resources and then utilize the resources down the line if you get stuck.

YOUR aim as someone trying to learn Python is to get EXCITED about it. You get excited when you recognize a problem you have that can
be solved by writing a program.  You can only do this once you understand enough about the language to see the possibilities.

The best way of explaining it is to tell you about my own experience.  When I learned enough Python, I started to see problems
in my life that I could solve with code.  "Oh, I could request information from an API, extract that information and create
a grading algorithm.  I'll use Tkinter like this, loop through the symbols like this, etc."  

For me, I was interested in investing in the stock market, so I built a program that
would help me with the market research required to make educated investment decisions.  Now that I am at home and do most of the
grocery shopping, I want to build an application that scrapes local grocery store websites for price by unit information so IDE
can see which places have the best prices for which products.
