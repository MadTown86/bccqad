# Episode 1: Getting Started

"""
I am on a mission to start teaching Python for those who are new to programming.  I name this Blue Collar Codes because I come from a blue collar background.

I taught myself Python by reading up to page 1313 of the book Learning Python by Mark Lutz.  I created multiple projects on github, completed
LeetCode problems, CodeWars Katas, and HackerRank problems.  I also streamed for a while as GrovesDaMan on Twitch and plan to continue streaming again
after I get a few episodes of this series done.

This was the path I chose to learn Python and I ultimately want to save you time.  Reading a book page-by-page is not very efficient considering how much
BLOAT is included.  

Unfortunately, you will always have to drudge through the basics and thats why I recommend going through my beginners series.  It
is jam-packed with information, but concise as I am trying to make the videos as close to 5 minutes as possible.
